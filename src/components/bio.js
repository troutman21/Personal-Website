          My day to day is spent building scaleable React/Node applications and managing a team of 5+ engineers. Iâ€™m especially passionate about advanced React features, declarative programming, and arguing the merits of vanilla Javascript over jQuery. At Codesmith I give technical lectures on classic computer science theory and all things modern web development, including data structures, time complexity, front-end fundamentals, React, Node, Dev-Ops, AJAX, Asynchronous Javascript, etc.

          Additionally, I have an affinity for public speaking and hosting technology based workshops. Currently, I run a weekly Build a Web App (BAWA) workshop on fundamental programming topics (Intro to React, Web Browser APIs, DOM Manipulation, and Node)
